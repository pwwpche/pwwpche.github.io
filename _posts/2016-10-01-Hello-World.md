Hello, World! The new site is ready, and the old one was archived into another repository. 

<del>There is a same copy currently stored in UCSD CSE server, but later on there will be only a redirection to my github site. </del>

It's done. There is only a main page in UCSD CSE server now.

And...Happy National Day when I am not having a single day for vacation :) Cheers!
