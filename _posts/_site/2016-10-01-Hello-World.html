<p>Hello, World! The new site is ready, and the old one was archived into another repository.</p>

<p><del>There is a same copy currently stored in UCSD CSE server, but later on there will be only a redirection to my github site. </del>
It’s done. There is only a main page in UCSD CSE server now.</p>

<p>And…Happy National Day when I am not having a single day for vacation :) Cheers!</p>
